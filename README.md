**Challenges Faced:**  
Handling negative numbers by using absolute value.

**Learning:**  
Learned digit-wise operations.

---

### 11. LCM and GCD
**Approach:**  
Used Python’s `math.gcd()` for GCD and formula for LCM.

**Challenges Faced:**  
Understanding GCD-LCM relationship.

**Learning:**  
Learned use of built-in math library and number theory basics.

---

### 12. List Reversal (Without Built-in reverse())
**Approach:**  
Reversed a list manually using two-pointer method.

**Challenges Faced:**  
Handling index swapping correctly.

**Learning:**  
Strengthened knowledge of list indexing.

---

### 13. Sort a List
**Approach:**  
Used Python’s built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list.

**Challenges Faced:**  
None.

**Learning:**  
Practiced use of built-in functions.

---

### 14. Remove Duplicates from List
**Approach:**  
Converted list to set and back to list to remove duplicates.

**Challenges Faced:**  
Preserving original order (could improve using collections in future).

**Learning:**  
Learned about Python sets and their properties.

---

### 15. String Length (Without len())
**Approach:**  
Manually counted characters in a string using a loop.

**Challenges Faced:**  
None.

**Learning:**  
Strengthened looping concepts.

---

### 16. Count Vowels and Consonants
**Approach:**  
Iterated through each character and checked if it’s a vowel or consonant.

**Challenges Faced:**  
Differentiating between vowels, consonants, and non-alphabet characters.

**Learning:**  
Improved string iteration and conditional checks.

---

### 17. Caesar Cipher (Encryption & Decryption)
**Approach:**  
Shifted each letter by a key value (both for encryption and decryption).

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Handling wrap-around cases for 'z' and 'Z'.  
- Maintaining case sensitivity.  
- Ignoring special characters.

**Learning:**  
Learned basics of text encryption and decryption.

---

### 18. Maze Generator and Solver
**Approach:**  
Created a simple 2D maze using lists and solved it using depth-first search (DFS) or similar traversal.

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Representing the maze grid.  
- Finding a path from start to end.  
- Handling boundary conditions.

**Learning:**  
Understood recursion and backtracking. Gained knowledge of problem-solving in grid-based environments.
